Taking answers from previous question:

Conflict misses = Total misses - compulsory misses - capacity misses

(i) compulsory misses = 15
		capacity misses = 1
		conflict misses = (23 - 15 - 1) = 7

(ii) compulsory misses = 15
		capacity misses = 1
		conflict misses = (19 - 15 - 1) = 3

(iii) compulsory misses = 15
		capacity misses = 1
		conflict misses = (17 - 15 - 1) = 1

(iv) compulsory misses = 15
		capacity misses = 1
		conflict misses = 0
